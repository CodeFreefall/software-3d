<h1>Basic 3D Software Renderer</h1>

It uses memory and math to draw pretty pictures. No OpenGL or other libraries (within reason).

Things are simply being rendered to a .bmp file, and this was only tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).

Here's a basic rectangle with a solid clear color in the background:

Line drawing is now also fully supported:

<img src="docs/examples/lines.bmp" width=50%>
<img src="docs/examples/color-wheel.bmp" width=50%>

Full 360 degree motion.

Circles are fully supported as well:
